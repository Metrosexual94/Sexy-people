In terms of vision acuity, the "best vision code" is considered to be 20/10 vision; this means that you can see details at 20 feet away that most people would need to be 10 feet away to see clearly, essentially giving you sharper than average vision. 
Key points about vision codes:
20/20 vision: Considered "normal" or "average" vision. 
Better than 20/20: Vision codes like 20/15 or 20/10 indicate better than average vision.
